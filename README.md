# Scanner
This is a simple OCR software.

Earlier I designed a text scanner which could take photos of paper text and recognize words on it. But for many reasons, it was delayed. 

Now I'm starting to make it a reality.

This scanner is based on WPF, and some functions is implemented by invoking the interfaces of some open source projects. 

In the future, we will do our best to improve the accuracy rate.
